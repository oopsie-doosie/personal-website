## Work Experience

**Goldman Sachs (Salt Lake City)**  
*Software Engineer*  
*September 2022 - Present*

*   Designed and implemented core components of the v2 reporting engine (25+ tables) to drive the rendering of **200k+ daily reports** (millions of pages). Decoupled presentation logic from data fetching, enabling dynamic grouping/sorting for clients with **20k+ pages/day** and paving the way for a **3x scale-up**.

*   Developed reusable internal **Java libraries** adopted by **3+ teams**, reducing boilerplate code by standardizing error handling and logging across the division.
*   Led a legacy codebase modernization effort, removing **400+ unused files** and increasing test coverage from **3% to 60%**, which significantly reduced regression bugs and enabled daily deployments.

**Appreciate (Remote)**  
*Software Engineering Intern*  
*March 2022 - June 2022*

*   Optimized Python (Flask) endpoints by implementing a tiered Redis caching strategy, reducing P99 latency by **70%**.
